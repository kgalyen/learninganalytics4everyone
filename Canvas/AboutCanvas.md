# About Canvas Learning Management system Files

These files are to assist the beginner in exploring Canvas data in ways that the Canvas course doesn't currently allow you to (mainly due to the fact that everyone has their own questions and custom areas they want to look into. 

I will primarily use R, R Studio, Excel, and point towards Tableau. 

The files are extensively commented and include links to resources and tutorial videos in the comments so that you can follow along with your own course data. 

If you have questions, please let me know and I'll be happy to create more tutorials and code.
